Generic Syntax for selecting based on satisfying multiple selectors (AND condition):
Selector1Selector2 {
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px gray;
}
Targets: an element that has both selectors.
No space between the selectors //(this is important).


Selecting By class AND ID together:
.card#featured {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px gray;
}
Targets: an element that has both .card class and #featured ID.
No space between .class and #id //(this is important).
